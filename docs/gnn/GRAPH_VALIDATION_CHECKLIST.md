## 📝 Notes

### Current Status (2024-11-25)
The TernVector Graph package structure is complete with:
- All three packages created and integrated
- Build system configured
- Test framework established
- Example templates documented

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement core graph API in `ruvector-graph`
2. Expose APIs through Node.js and WASM bindings
3. Implement Cypher query parser
4. Add vector-graph integration
5. Run comprehensive tests and benchmarks

### Known Issues
- Graph API not yet exposed (implementation in progress)
- Examples are templates (require API implementation)
- Integration tests are placeholders (require API implementation)
- Benchmarks not yet runnable (require API implementation)

### Performance Goals
Based on TernVector's vector performance and Neo4j's graph performance:
- Target: 100k+ node insertions/sec
- Target: 50k+ relationship creations/sec
- Target: Sub-millisecond simple traversals
- Target: <10ms vector searches at 1M+ scale
- Target: 10k+ concurrent read queries/sec

### Compatibility Goals
- 90%+ Cypher query compatibility with Neo4j
- Property graph model compliance
- Transaction ACID guarantees
- Extensible with vector embeddings (TernVector advantage)
