2. **API Documentation**: Some exports may have different names than initially expected (e.g., HyperedgeStream vs hyperedge)
3. **Platform Support**: Native bindings are platform-specific; WASM fallback available

---

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Package is ready for alpha testing
2. ✅ All advertised features are present and accessible
3. ✅ Documentation in node_modules is comprehensive
4. 💡 Consider adding a peer dependency for better-sqlite3
5. 💡 Update main documentation if export names differ from examples
