# AgentDB Comprehensive Demonstrations

This directory contains a comprehensive exploration of AgentDB's capabilities, showcasing the full power of the 2.0.0-alpha.2.11 release.

## 🎯 What's Included

### 1. Vector Search (`vector-search/`)
**File**: `semantic-search.js`

Demonstrates AgentDB's blazing-fast vector search capabilities using TernVector:
- **150x faster** than cloud-based alternatives
- Sub-millisecond query latency
- Semantic similarity search
- Filtered search by metadata
- Performance benchmarking

**Key Features**:
- HNSW indexing
- Cosine similarity
- Real-time search
- Native Rust performance

**Run it**:
```bash
node demos/vector-search/semantic-search.js
```

### 2. Attention Mechanisms (`attention/`)
**File**: `all-mechanisms.js`

Showcases all 5 attention mechanisms included in AgentDB:

1. **Multi-Head Attention** - Standard transformer attention with parallel heads
2. **Flash Attention** - Memory-efficient block-wise computation
3. **Linear Attention** - O(N) complexity using kernel approximations
4. **Hyperbolic Attention** - Poincaré ball model for hierarchical data
5. **MoE Attention** - Mixture of Experts with dynamic routing

**Key Features**:
- All 5 mechanisms demonstrated
- Performance comparisons
- Use case explanations
- Expert routing visualization

**Run it**:
```bash
node demos/attention/all-mechanisms.js
```

### 3. Self-Discovery System (`self-discovery/`)
**File**: `cognitive-explorer.js`

A cognitive system that autonomously explores its own capabilities:

**What It Does**:
- Discovers and catalogs its own abilities
- Stores discoveries in semantic memory
- Reflects on performance patterns
- Builds hierarchical knowledge graphs
- Generates insights from experience

**Cognitive Patterns Demonstrated**:
- Self-awareness through performance monitoring
- Pattern recognition across discoveries
- Hierarchical knowledge organization
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Meta-cognition (thinking about thinking)

**Key Features**:
- Autonomous exploration
- Semantic memory storage
- Knowledge graph construction
- Performance analysis
- Insight generation

**Run it**:
```bash
node demos/self-discovery/cognitive-explorer.js
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Dependencies
All demonstrations use:
- `agentdb@2.0.0-alpha.2.11` - Main package
- `ruvector@0.1.26` - Vector search
- `@ruvector/attention@0.1.1` - Attention mechanisms

### Generated Files
The demonstrations create several database files:
- `demos/vector-search/semantic-db.bin` - Vector search index
- `demos/self-discovery/memory.bin` - Cognitive memory storage

These files persist across runs, so subsequent executions will be faster.

### System Requirements
- Node.js 16+
- ~100MB RAM per demo
- ~10MB disk space for generated files

## 📚 Code Examples

### Using Vector Search
```javascript
const { VectorDB } = require('ruvector');

const db = new VectorDB({
  dimensions: 128,
  maxElements: 1000
});

const vector = new Float32Array(128).fill(0.1);
await db.insert({ id: 'doc1', vector, metadata: { title: 'Example' } });

const results = await db.search(vector, 5);
```

### Using Attention Mechanisms
```javascript
const { MultiHeadAttention, HyperbolicAttention } = require('@ruvector/attention');

// Multi-head for general tasks
const mha = new MultiHeadAttention(64, 4);
const output = mha.compute(query, keys, values);

// Hyperbolic for hierarchies
const hyp = new HyperbolicAttention(64, -1.0);
const hierOutput = hyp.compute(query, keys, values);
```
